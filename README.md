# neural-net-spam-classifier

This repository contains my university coursework project where I implemented a feedforward neural network from scratch to classify emails as spam or not spam.

## Project Overview

- The dataset consists of **binary features** describing email characteristics.
- The task is a **binary classification problem**: predicting whether an email is spam (`1`) or not spam (`0`).
- The neural network has one hidden layer, using ReLU activation in the hidden layer and Sigmoid activation in the output layer.
- Training is performed using backpropagation and gradient descent with an exponentially decaying learning rate.

## Important Notes

- The source code is **not included** here due to university coursework regulations.
- This repository contains documentation and explanations of the methodology, design decisions, and results.

## Summary

This project highlights how neural networks can capture complex, nonlinear relationships among binary features to improve spam detection performance compared to simpler algorithms like Naive Bayes.
